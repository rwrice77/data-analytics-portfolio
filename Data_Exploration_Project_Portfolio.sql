-- Goal: Explore layoff trends after cleaning the dataset
-- =======================================================

-- STEP 0: Inspect dataset
-- SELECT * FROM layoffs_staging2 LIMIT 10;

-- 1. General Statistics
-- =======================================================

-- Maximum and minimum layoffs in single events

SELECT MAX(total_laid_off) AS MaxLayoffs, MIN(total_laid_off) AS MinLayoffs
FROM layoffs_staging2;

-- Companies with 100% layoffs (shutdowns)

SELECT company, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1;

-- 2. Layoffs by Company / Industry / Country
-- =======================================================

-- Total layoffs by company

SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off) AS TotalLayoffs

FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY TotalLayoffs DESC;

-- Total layoffs by country

SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off) AS TotalLayoffs
FROM layoffs_staging2

SELECT  `Month`, total_off,
SUM(total_off) OVER(ORDER BY `Month`) AS rolling_total
FROM Rolling_Total;

-- 4. Company Rankings
-- =======================================================

-- Top companies with most layoffs overall

SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off) AS TotalLayoffs
FROM layoffs_staging2

-- Top 5 companies by year (using CTE + window function)

SELECT company, YEAR(`date`), SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2

-- ðŸ“Œ Insights Summary
-- =======================================================
--   Geography:
--   The United States and India reported the highest numbers of layoffs,

--   the most heavily impacted industries, highlighting broad sector-wide
--   effects beyond just technology.
--
--   Companies:

--   the highest layoffs, showing that even established companies were
--   forced into significant workforce reductions.
--
--   Time Trends:
--   Layoff activity peaked during 2022 and 2023, suggesting global
--   economic uncertainty and post-pandemic corrections played major roles.
--   Rolling totals clearly illustrate a steep rise in layoffs during this
--   period before beginning to level off.
--
--   Conclusion:

--   company, or industry. Instead, they were widespread, with particular
--   intensity in large global tech firms. The peak years of 2022â€“2023
--   will be important focal points for further exploratory analysis and
--   visualization.
