# ðŸ“Š Excel Project â€“ Bike Buyers Demographics Analysis  

## Overview  
This project explores a **bike buyers dataset** to uncover demographic and behavioral patterns that influence purchasing decisions. Using Excel, I built PivotTables, charts, and a dashboard to make insights easily interpretable for stakeholders.  

The project demonstrates how Excel can be leveraged for:  
- Quick data cleaning & preparation  
- Summarizing trends with PivotTables  
- Designing interactive dashboards for decision-making

## Dataset  
- **Source**: Bike Buyers dataset (sample)  
- **Size**: ~1,000 records  
- **Key fields**:  
  - `Age`, `Gender`, `Marital Status`  
  - `Income`, `Education`  
  - `Commute Distance`, `Region`  
  - `Purchased Bike`

## Objectives  
- Identify trends in bike purchases by **age, gender, and income**.  
- Understand **regional differences** in customer behavior.  
- Build a **dashboard** to summarize key findings for business users.  

---

## Methods & Features  
- **PivotTables**: Aggregated purchases by age, income brackets, and commute distance.  
- **PivotCharts**: Visualized purchase patterns across demographics.  
- **Dashboard**: Combined visuals and filters for an at-a-glance summary.  
- **Slicers**: Enabled interactivity to filter by gender, region, and marital status.

## Insights  
- Younger professionals (ages 30â€“40) showed the **highest bike purchase rates**.  
- Income levels between **$40,000â€“$70,000** were most associated with purchases.  
- Commute distances of **0â€“10 miles** correlated strongly with buying a bike.  
- Regional differences suggested marketing opportunities in the **Pacific Northwest**.
