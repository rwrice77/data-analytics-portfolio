# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio  

Hi, I’m **Robert**. This repository is my hands-on data analytics portfolio, created as I transition into a **junior data analyst role**.  

- ✅ **SQL projects (complete):** Data cleaning and exploratory analysis on a real-world layoffs dataset.  
- 🔄 **Excel & Power BI projects (in progress):** Building dashboards and visual reports to strengthen my skills in visualization and storytelling.  
- 🎯 **Goal:** Demonstrate my ability to work with messy datasets, perform analysis, and create insights that drive business decisions.  

Each section of this portfolio highlights a different tool I’m learning and applying: **SQL for data cleaning and exploration, Excel for modeling and reporting, and Power BI for interactive dashboards.**
